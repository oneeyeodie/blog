Hi my name is Christopher. One Eye Odie is a project I’ve started to remove some of the frustration I’ve felt taking part in my favorite pastime. Gaming. By looking at the parts of games that are giving me a hard time and thinking of ways those parts could be reworked or tweaked to alleviate some if not all of the frustration  does in fact allow me to enjoy gaming once again.

I’ve recently lost quite a bit of my field of vision, blind in my left eye and in my right eye blind in about the top 3rd of my field of vision. This happened a little over a year before figuring out the idea for this blog.

I am using the [ Game Accessibility Guidelines ](http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com) as a starting point. There are certain parts of the guide that pertain to my impairment and it helps to structure my reviews of games.

The parts I have cherry picked from the Game Accessibility Guidelines are:

#### Visual Guidelines####
Basic|Intermediate|Advanced
-----|------------|--------
Readable Font | Provide Option to Adjust Contrast | Allow Font Size to be Adjusted
Clear Text Formatting | Provide Choice of Cursor Designs/Colors | Allow Easy Orientation and/or Movement Along Compass Directions 
High Contrast Between Text/UI and Backgrounds | Clean Indication of interactive Elements |
Interactive Elements are Large and Well Placed | Avoid Placing Essential Information Out of Player Eye Line |
 | Allow Interface to be Resized |   

#### General Guidelines####
Basic|Intermediate|Advanced
-----|------------|--------
Provide Details of Accessibility Options| Include Impaired Gamers in Testing | Allow Many/All Types of Impaired Players in Testing
Wide Choice of Difficulties | Include Assist Modes ex. Auto-Aim, Auto-Steer | Allow Settings to be Save in Different Profiles
Save and Remember Settings | Manual Save Feature | 
Allow Accessibility Feedback | Auto Save Feature | 

So that is one half of my posts, the other half I provide my ideas for solutions to improving the accessibility of the game. Each time I do find an area that is challenging I will do my best to share my ideas for possible solutions that will minify their impact on gameplay. My goal isn’t to come up with ideas that make games easier to beat, just easier to play. If that makes any sense.
