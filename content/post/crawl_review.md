I lost the majority of my vision along with a lot of the fun that comes with playing video games. I decided that I wasn’t going to play just for fun. I would focus on what was more difficult now and figure out what I would change to make playing more enjoyable. I want to have fun playing games again despite my new disability.

Crawl is a game that I have been interested in playing for while. It was on my Steam wishlist for a few months and I finally pulled the trigger and bought the game.  Crawl was to be my first game that I played with my new outlook.

It was exciting. I was paying attention to details I never thought about before and instead of getting frustrated while playing I was more engaged. It was a new and different kind of fun. There were a few issues that I expected going into this project such as losing track of my character. There were other things that I thought I would have a hard time with that ended up being easier to deal with than I thought. An example would be reading the text. There were also a few things I didn’t expect at all.

### How was the Text Handled? ###

I first paid attention to the text that popped up on screen during the tutorial part of the game. The text had nice clean sharp edges so they didn’t blur together for me. The text was also, always, on a black background which provided a nice contrast that made the text stand out easily.

The one issue that I had with the pop up dialog text boxes was minor in the tutorial. There were a couple text boxes that appeared in different locations of the screen as I left the tutorial area that appeared in different locations. I didn’t notice them right away as they popped up because I was already used to looking for text on the top of the screen. Fortunately they only contained story text that was also voiced over and there was nothing to do but leave the room so gameplay wasn’t affected.

One more thing about the text that I did appreciate was the fact some words were a different color than the rest of the text. Words that demanded attention were written in bright red compared to the rest of the text. These key words and phrases helped me figure out what the rest of the text was about quickly.

Colored text was used again in the shop when looking at the items. The different stats used colors like red and green that made it easy to glance and see if a weapon was an upgrade that I was interested in or not. The information about the various items were structured similar to each other and the location of the information was consistently placed. After seeing the item information displayed a few items I wasted no time looking for the information.

The only downside, I could think of, to the font used was the lack of customization. The options to change size, color, and font doesn’t exist. 

That being said, the font size used along with the colors and style was adequate enough for me. Overall the text didn’t provide any difficulty while playing Crawl.

The text was handled well with only a few tweaks that would improve it. Such as allowing the size of the text to be adjusted.

### How Easy Were the Interactions? ###

There were two main ways to interact with objects in the game world. One as the player, fighting enemies, breaking pots, spending gold on gear, and avoiding traps. The other way was as a ghost controlling the traps, throwing pots at the player, and summoning and controlling a monster to attack the player with.

I will stat off by covering my experiences with controlling the player first before coving what it was like for me to control the ghost after I died as the player.

The tutorial had shown what I could and could not do as the player. Mainly attacking monsters with regular and special moves and smashing pots and other objects in the room.

Of course the tutorial couldn’t show you how to use all of the special attacks a player would come across, but there was one skill that was tricky for me to use. That was a floating rune that floated around my player. What was difficult for me about it was I could fire it in a different direction than where my play was facing and moving towards. I had a hard time keeping track of where it was and which way I would fire it during the fast paced combat. I didn’t use it for very long before switching it out at the next shop I came across for a bow attack.

There was a targeting element to that ability but that was difficult for me to see during the combat as well. It was a short and thin arrow with a dashed line for the shaft of the arrow that didn’t stand out enough unless I really focused on looking for it.

This indicator was also used for some enemy attacks and even though it was hard for me to notice my own theirs was easier since I was focused on the enemies already. It would have been nice if my aiming arrows would have been easier to see, either by making them slightly larger or by adding a black outline that would make them stand out more.

There was one more thing about the special attacks that was a bit difficult for me and that was the indicator telling you the special attack was ready for use.

It was a feint white swirl at the players feet. This is the opposite to the indicator that appeared when you regular attacks were on cool down. This was a bright red circle that stood out easily for me even in the middle of combat.
The item shop was very easy to figure out. The items were consistently laid out with weapons, potions, and skill books always located in the same places in each shop. The prices of the items were easy to read and also consistently placed below each item for sale.

As far as I could tell there was no way to heal, but once you died the ghost that killed you comes to life as the new player and you become one of the three ghosts.

The first time I was a ghost I had a hard time keeping track of where I was compared to the other ghosts. Each ghost is a different color and that didn’t help some, but the fact that they were some what transparent and there really wasn’t a clear indicator as to which one I was made handling a ghost take longer to get used to than controlling the player. By player I mean the hero in this case.

As a ghost you could pick up and throw the breakable objects at the player, activate and control traps, and stand on a pentagram to summon a monster to control all to damage the player.

The ghosts were slightly transparent which gave me some trouble at times trying to figure out where the ghost I was controlling was compared to the other ghosts. They each had a different color but a bold solid outline of the one I was controlling would have made locating the ghost I controlled so much easier.

Again the aim assisting arrows as a ghost had the same challenges as they did when I was the hero using special attacks. The same suggestion for fixing them applies here as well.

The pentagrams to stand on and summon a monster were difficult to see for me as they were just a slightly darker shade than the surrounding floor. The one saving grace in a pinch was they turned bright red when you stood on them as a ghost.

If they had been a darker or dull red color to provide more contrast to the rest of the floor when you weren’t standing on them they would have been easier for me to locate them.

One I used a pentagram to summon a monster to control and attack the player, there were times I simply lost track of the one I was in control of. Some kind of indicator, like the one suggested above for the ghost would have been nice. Even a simple arrow above the head of the one I was controlling would have worked instead of a bolder outline.

The difficulties I had when controlling the ghost didn’t feel bad while I was playing with just computer controlled players, but I could see my self getting frustrated playing against other human players. The frustration would stem from the fact that I would feel that I couldn’t control my characters as easily as the other players and feel at a disadvantage. The reason I would feel at a disadvantage is the ghost that kills the hero is the ghost that becomes reborn as the hero.
 
Overall finding things to interact with was easy enough and only thing that would make it easier would be to make the indicators for the character I was controlling stand out more.

Given enough time playing the game I would slowly improve on my own but there was still be that lingering feeling that I could play better if only certain things were easier for me to see.

### Movement, Good and Bad ###

My first play through I used the keyboard and movement was easy enough to handle. You had eight directional movement with the arrow keys and your attacks were normal on ‘Z’ and special on ‘X’. The enter key worked to select options and the Escape key back you out of options in the menus. The arrow keys also rocked for navigating menus.

Movement with the mouse was very difficult for me to control. Your player moved towards the mouse cursor which was difficult for me to track. The cursor was made of three small squares that blended into the floor for me. There was a large arrow at the characters feet that pointed towards the curso but again it bleed into the floor too much for me unless I took time to focus on it. The other part of movement with the mouse that was difficult for me was the speed at which the character ran. The further away from the character the faster he moved, because I couldn’t keep track of the cursor very well I had a hard time controlling my characters speed. 

Attacking with he mouse was also a bit of a challenge for mostly the same reasons as movement was. The cursor was difficult to track and the aim arrows also didn’t stand out enough for me during combat. The attack keys were simple though with the left mouse button being the standard attacks and the right the special attacks.

Another option was the controller and this was by far the easiest way for me to play. Because the character simply moved in the direction I pressed the control stick and his speed was determined by how much I tilted the control stick. I didn’t need the aim guides nearly as much either.

### Odds and Ends ###

Here I will talk about all of the other sections Iv’e pulled from the Game Accessibility Guidelines that I haven’t covered yet. Some of the guidelines didn’t apply to this game and some I couldn’t find any information on. The rest were minor when it came to my enjoyment of playing Crawl.

There were no mention of any accessibility options, probably because there were few. As I mentioned about the text above, there were no customization options. You could toggle the screen shake along with the game tips. Neither of those options affected my experience while playing the game.

I couldn’t find any information about any beta testers for this game online. So I couldn’t tell if any of the testers had any kind of impairment. To be honest I didn’t expect to find that information.

There was a lack of settings that didn’t exist. Such as contrast, brightness, font size, font color, font type, cursor size, cursor style, and cursor color. 

Contrast may have helped in some areas such as the indicators that were difficult for me to see easily enough with out taking focus off of gameplay.

The cursor settings were non-existent. Which was okay because gameplay was easiest for me with a controller. The keyboard controls were also adequate enough to play the game although they didn’t offer as much control as the controller did. Gameplay with the mouse was very difficult for me though and would need changes to the cursor to make it usable for me. 

The ability to change the size of the cursor would go a long way in making the mouse usable for me along with adding in a high contrast option for the cursor. With those changes the arrow at the players feet wouldn’t be as necessary. 

Two settings you cold change, besides volume settings, was the resolution and a toggle between fullscreen or windowed. Both of these settings didn’t change my gameplay experience in anyway.

The game had some interface information along the bottom of the screen and at times along the top of the screen. I didn’t pay much attention to the bottom section of the interface because it took substantially more time than just a glance to gather information from there. Part of my problem these days is waiting for my vision to refocus after changing the area of my focus quickly. 

I did use the interface information at the top of the screen but doing so did to hamper my gameplay because the information here was used primarily in the tutorial and the shop, when there was little action going on at the same time.

There wasn’t a way to save the settings in their own profile but the settings were remembered the next time that you opened the game. With he limited number of settings available there really isn’t a need to save them in individual profiles.

### Summary ###

Overall my gaming experience was pretty good. I avoided the mouse controls and used the keyboard, or even better, a controller the gameplay wasn’t overly difficult to keep up with. On top of using the controller I set the difficulty on the easy setting and capped the number of NPCs to two.

If I increased the difficulty or added the last available NPC there wasn’t enough time for me to keep track of what ws going on with my limited vision. The mouse controls were by far more difficult for me to use than both the keyboard and controller due to the cursor choice.

The two main things I would suggest to tighten up gameplay for my disability would be to add options for the style and size of the cursor. The second thing be allowing the contrast to be adjusted. Specifically, the ability to change the contrast on the assist elements like the indicators for movement, aiming, and attack cool downs.
